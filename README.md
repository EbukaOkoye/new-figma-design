# Description


This is a design gotten from a figma model. While waiting for a new adventure in front-end web development, I was given a figma design by my facilitator. The aim of working with a figma design according to him was to help understand and know how to work with the UI/UX designers in any tech firm I might find myself in. This design is that of a virtual reality game glasses and other products they offer to the public. The webpage is a responsive one on all screen size. i used a little bit of javascript in this project for some DOM manipulation where clicking on the Logo would shrink the sidenav.
